    # Notes (bugs, help, about the author)                                   #
    # This particular version was designed for eggdrop 1.4.x (made on 1.4.4) #
    # you can test it out on other versions of eggdrop if you wish. but its  #
    # only designed to work with 1.3.9, so i recommend you get it            #
    # also.. ive had several people (lamers) asking me why the script wont   #
    # work, that is because they are dumb fucks that dont listen, i said 0.8 #
    # only worked on eggdrop 1.3.9, but these particular people loaded it up #
    # on versions like 1.6.1 and 1.5.4, these people have pissed me off so   #
    # much, if purposley put a bug in it to prevent it being loaded by lame  #
    # fucks. also, loading this script on winegg is pointless :)             #
    #                                                                        #
    # oh yer. dont use the `fun commands around sensative woman or children  #
    # i might take the bad attitude out if enough people complain ;P         #

    # ver 0.1 - 0.7: never released. development stages.                     #
    #                                                                        #
    # ver 0.8: 95% done.. i think. added owner settings in, option to        #
    # disable security features (op restrict, mustid etc), fixed a few       #
    # minor bugs, made a quota option for adding to the user/bot/ban         #
    # database, reduced size of script (made a few commands more             #
    # optimized), in traditional austnet lameness fashion, i also added      #
    # 8ball to it. notify adduser/deluser/set added, decided to make this    #
    # script open source and release it to a few people (to test it out)     #
    #
    # ver 0.9: bug fixes and a few additions. purposly bugged some areas to  #
    # prevent l4m3rz using it. fucking cunts keep privmsg'ing me expecting   #
    # me to walk them through it because they're tooooo fucking dumb to even #
    # start the bot. and for some fucked up reason. even tho i stated this   #
    # script wont work with 1.5.x or 1.6.x, these lamers think that my script#
    # is magical or someshit and assume it will run on any version you load  #
    # it up on. so a hearty "Fuck You" goes out to all those cunts that call #
    # my script shit because they're too fucking docile to read a .conf file #
    # and follow my instructions. anymore lamers who privmsg me asking for a #
    # walkthrough will most likely be feeling the wrath of my devestation.tcl#
    # and a nice lil /ignore.. annnyway where was i? oh yeah. yada yada yada #
    # this script is abit better then the last one.                          #

    # About: Based on the ChanOP bot on irc.AUSTnet.org, used to maintain    #
    # the channel #porTal since warez channels don't get OP services like    #
    # ChanOP, NoteOP etc, idea was 'kinda' stolen from Conqueror's           #
    # #mp3songs bots: DVD, bios, AWA & CRAY                                  #
    # i have implemented enough security into this script to ensure your     #
    # channel wont be taken. if it does. then id blame it on either:         #
    # A: your stupidity B: lazyness in setting up your bot properly          #
    # also, i purposly made it so only level 200 has +n access. this isnt    #
    # 'just another eggdrop' its more of a bot of its own kind.              #

    # help: copy it to your scripts/ directory                               #
    # and (unless you specify another directory to store the script) just    #
    # add the following line to your eggdrop config file:                    #
    # source scripts/chan0p/chan0p.conf                                      #
    # just .rehash your bot, and .setowner in dcc =]                         #
    # also setup your channel options. just type `defaultset in the channel  #
    # that will setup all the stuff for ya. it will be automatic in the      #
    # future. after thats done. `set your options ;)                         #

    # and another thing.. if you want your chan0p bot to be reet. before you #
    # compile it. edit eggdrop.h and change #define HANDLEN 9 (or whatever) #
    # to something like 16, that way you can adduser people with long nicks  #
    # you will be unable to bot link to other bots which DONT have this set  #
    # but atleast your access list will look sexy =]                         #
    # (thanks to Wintermute for that tip)                                    #
